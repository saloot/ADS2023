### [Divar](https://divar.ir)

I think Divar hardly needs an introduction, as it is the largest classified ads platform in Iran (and probably Afghanistan).

The [dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/saeedtqp/divaar) "contains 947635 posts that were published in Divar classified ads platform. These posts were published and archived before 2017."


### [Digikala](https://digikala.com)

The dataset contains over 2 million transactions and 100,000 goods offerred at Digikala.
